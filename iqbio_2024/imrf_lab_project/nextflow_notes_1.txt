# NanoRTax Diego Notes
# Edits to ask Diego about
Fuuuckk I thought I understood


# Next flow needs to run from my path
	- java

Wait is Java on Boqueron? Do we need to install it too?
	
What do we mean by user path?
Wait is the idea not to do it in boqueron? Or are we installing nextflow into boqueron?

# For boqueron add to user path
	- i.e. use mv, not source
	- can go to website of nextflow installation stuff
	- nextflow executable path (need to redo each time)
	- authorization with mando de autorizacion

How to get authorization, where is it needed?
	
Point to path of nextflow executable, but where exactly?
	
# envs folder miniconda
	- conda envs list to see
	- pipeline environment doesn't get saved to envs folder
	- conda activate (big long name)
	
Conda/miniconda isn't in boqueron? Install that too?
Where to find the big long name?
	
# command: export NXF_VER=22.10.0 (it's in the script)
	- sets nextflow version
	- can run old version of nextflow internally
	
Have the script, but where to run it from?

# Normalization
Huh? Like stats normalization?

# Quime has some kind of problem?
	- unexplicit step
	- merge replicas
	- problem with depth?
	- undersampling
	
Didn't really catch this tbh.

# Diversity
	- need scripts to do diversity
	- can do with phyloseq or vegan in R
