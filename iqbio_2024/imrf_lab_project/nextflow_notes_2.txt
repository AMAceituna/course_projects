# Notes NanoRTax 7/11

# Run executables from $PATH directory
	- Oh this is what tells the terminal what commands to have
	- So you put executables in this directory to have them be accessible fast instead of typing out whole address

# That shell script was for their server in particular

# Dependencies like conda and other stuff not in boqueron
	- conda
	- kraken2, centrifuge, blast (centrifuge not in boqueron)

# Tried to python env for use pip, but didnt' work
	- Need to get nextflow module (and dependencies)
	- Or possibly have Diego run it on the CCC server

# Modules are sort of like conda/docker environments
	- loads particular programs to save on efficiency

# install environment.yml 
	- profile parameters
