Drosophila As a Model Organism Notes

Nomenclature matters more than knowing specific mutation
	Capitalization matters in drosophila
	
Many genes named after the mutation because of early discoveries before genes themselves

Thomas Hunt Morgan 
	White eye mutants showed sex linked genes
	Many famous students and many nobel prizes from other fly discoveries (hox genes)
	
4 Chromosomes
	#4 is tiny and not really used. Doesn't mutate that much
	
Nomenclature:

Wildtype
	+/+;+/+ homozygous
		; is a separator
		Homozygous wild type shortened to just + or OreR or WT
		Male has +/7 in sex chroms

Non Wildtype
	Sb^1,e^1 Comma used as a separator that shows multiple alells on same chroms
	
Balancer Chroms
	lethal homozygous (recessive)
	visible markers
	no recombination
	
	"Balancer like"
		sometimes recombines
		
	It's like the mutation you want is unadaptive, so you need a balancer that is even less adaptive
	Otherwise it would get filtered out
	Needs to be lethal homozygously so that it's filtered out,
	and needs to be dominant, so you can tell the genotypes of
	heterozygotes
