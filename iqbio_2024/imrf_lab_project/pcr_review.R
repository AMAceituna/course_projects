# Components
  # Template DNA
  # DNA polymerase
  # primers
  # dNTPs
  # Required cofactor: Mg2+
  # Buffer

# Steps:
  # Denaturation into seperate strands 95 C
  # Annealing primers to each strand 54 C
  # Extension of new strands 72 C

# Repeat annealing step 30+ times
  # Each cycle doubles (ie it increses exponentailly by powers of two)

# Taq Polymerase
  # Extremeophile from archaea in Yellowstone
  # Polymerase would not denature each cycle from the heat

# Use 16s gene for bacteria
  # ribosomal subunit gene
  # Basically instant death for most mutations within the gene
  # Some regions that can vary some, allows for taxonomic analysis

# Primers are forward and reverse
  # Labeled by based number and F or R

# Primer design
  # 15-30 nt long
  # reverse must always be complementary direction of the forward primer

# Colony pcr
  # Lysed bacteria, not extracted genome
  # Easier to lyse gram negative

# Gram positive vs gram negative
  # extra peptidoglycan (positive) or extra memebrane (negative)

# 3 samples in the experiment
  # 25 ul total per sample
  # check dilutions
  # check temp
  # make sure that using correct primers

# Amplifying 430 bases in plantarum
  # 30 seconds per kb of dna
