# Biostats Workshop

# Graphs for categorical values
  # Bar plots
  # pie charts (careful)

# Graphs for quantitative variables ####

# Histogram not the same thing as a barplot
  # classes grouped in continguous bars 
  # area proportional to freq
  # number of classes matters

# Box and whisker
  # Box is interquartile range
  # Middle line is median
  # Whiskers are min and max (within acceptable limits)
  # possible outliers outside of whiskers (depends on algorithm)
  # Ideally present boxplot with dots superimposed upon it

# Robustness
  # median and interquartile range is robust

# Pearson coefficient of correlation
  # Big complicated formula
  # measures linear association between two variables

  # correlation != causation

# Statistical Inference
  # Probability as 

# Central limit theorem
  # Uhhh review what this is

# Point Estimators

# Confidence Intervals
  # Review all dis
  # Larger the confidence the larger the interval
