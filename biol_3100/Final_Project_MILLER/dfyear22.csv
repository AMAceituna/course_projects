Actually this is a subject of some debate, because although Freud had read Darwin and is known to have referred to him in some of his letters and writings, it's possible that he was really more compelled by what we'd refer to as ""Proto-Darwinist"" thought, including such concepts as phylogeny.

Here's a bit of an explanation for those who have interest.
In ""Modern Man In Search of A Soul,"" Jung describes the confessional as a societal precursor of psychoanalysis. According to his view, confession is the first step in the psychoanalytic process - and a cause of great relief. He thinks that anything which we feel the need to keep secret from others becomes like an alienating sin to us. Confession undoes that alienation- it's the reestablishment of appropriate relationship. A person can feel accepted because they confess. 

Upon closer examination, confession plays an important roll in more than just the healing process of therapy- it's necessary to enter a romantic relationship, or to make amends with a person who has been offended. Confession also occurs on a larger social scale, celebrities feel compelled to confess to the public whenever the tides of public opinion turn against them. Confession also plays an interesting role in cult psychology and the psychology of reeducation and prison camps.

In all cases, the goal of confession is the establishment or reestablishment of a relationship, and the thereby alleviation of a sense of alienation.",51,115,3,1630,208,TRUE,"Wednesday"
