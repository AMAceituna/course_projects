""I will come to a time in my backwards trip when November eleventh, accidentally my birthday, was a sacred day called Armistice Day. When I was a boy, all the people of all the nations which had fought in the First World War were silent during the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of Armistice Day, which was the eleventh day of the eleventh month.
It was during that minute in nineteen hundred and eighteen, that millions upon millions of human beings stopped butchering one another. I have talked to old men who were on battlefields during that minute. They have told me in one way or another that the sudden silence was the Voice of God. So we still have among us some men who can remember when God spoke clearly to mankind.
Armistice Day has become Veterans' Day. Armistice Day was sacred. Veterans' Day is not.
So I will throw Veterans' Day over my shoulder. Armistice Day I will keep. I don't want to throw away any sacred things.""

Here's a bit of an explanation for those who have interest.
In ""Modern Man In Search of A Soul,"" Jung describes the confessional as a societal precursor of psychoanalysis. According to his view, confession is the first step in the psychoanalytic process - and a cause of great relief. He thinks that anything which we feel the need to keep secret from others becomes like an alienating sin to us. Confession undoes that alienation- it's the reestablishment of appropriate relationship. A person can feel accepted because they confess. 

Upon closer examination, confession plays an important roll in more than just the healing process of therapy- it's necessary to enter a romantic relationship, or to make amends with a person who has been offended. Confession also occurs on a larger social scale, celebrities feel compelled to confess to the public whenever the tides of public opinion turn against them. Confession also plays an interesting role in cult psychology and the psychology of reeducation and prison camps.

In all cases, the goal of confession is the establishment or reestablishment of a relationship, and the thereby alleviation of a sense of alienation.",51,115,3,1630,876,TRUE,"Wednesday"
