# 1.

  # I'm going to make a bold scientific claim that Mushrooms can't ungrow themselves.
    # Idk tho. Fungi are weird.
  # I assume that mushrooms also don't grow faster in a dry 50 C environment.
  # Models are models. A simple line isn't going to be able to truly predict very far out.
  # The temp collected was also only 20 or 25 which is a pretty small range to extrapolate from.

# 2.

  # The relationship with light in the second plot in #2 looked a little exponential.

  # Well it's basic and not specifically about R, but a log() was the first thing that came to mind.

  # This seems more like it but 1. I barely understand it and 2. #3 is asking for a "linear model" of nonlinear data

# 3.

nonlinear <- read.csv("./non_linear_relationship.csv")

nonlinear %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=predictor,y=response)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
  # Well it certainly doesn't look linear

  # I'm not entirely sure what is being asked by "with a linear model"
  # Isn't any linear model of nonlinear data going to be way off?

  # You could just make it linear with glm and have a crappy model:
crappymod <- glm(data = nonlinear,
                 formula = response ~ predictor)
summary(crappymod)

  # Could just plot the log() of the response and make it linear that way
nonlinear %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=predictor,y= log(response))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal()
  # Linear, but it seems like we've modified the data we want.

logmod <- glm(data = nonlinear,
                 formula = log(response) ~ predictor)
summary(logmod)
compare_performance(crappymod,logmod) %>% plot
  # Well, it's better in most ways.
